# Project: Predicting-Final-Term-Marks-of-Students
 This project is not only about prediction of marks but also analysis done on a real-world student dataset and exploring characteristics that could potentially impact     students' grades as well as visualizations.
 
➢Introduction

In this notebook, we will conduct exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Seaborn to find any relationships between student background and student performance in the final term. We will also explore any possible reasonings to our insights and finish up with any key insights that we find.

Motivation

The use of machine learning and data mining techniques has exploded in recent years with the field of educational data mining making significant growth in the past two decades. Physics Education Research has benefitted from educational data mining adding to the scientific literacy tremendously. However, relatively less work was done in primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) and minority-serving institutions. As part of an effort to provide evidence for the reproducibility of educational studies for a variety of student body as well exploring possible gender or racial gaps in student’s performance, data was collected over a year-long period for a number of introductory physics courses at this institution (both a PUI and Hispanic serving institution) to understand factors that affect students’ performance in an introductory Physics Course as well as the Force Concept Inventory
Problem Statement

Given access to institional data on students taking an introductory calculus-based mechanics course (e.g. Gender, SAT Scores, ACT Scores, High School GPA, Math Score (when applicable), Force Concept Inventory Score, etc...), can we identify any trends in student performance and more importantly, can we find an explanation for these trends. To accomplish this task, we will use a set of real-world data collected from students enrolled in Physics 131 for the entire 2017 Academic Year at this institution.

Note: FCI is a measure of a student's understanding of Newtonian Mechanics. Used to assess student's understanding of Newtonian Mechanics post-course
